39:24, SGL Entry 1 (SGL1): This field contains the first SGL segment for the command. If the SGL segment is an SGL Data Block or Keyed SGL Data Block or Transport SGL Data Block descriptor, then it describes the entire data transfer. If more than one SGL segment is needed to describe the data transfer, then the first SGL segment is a Segment, or Last Segment descriptor. Refer to section 4.3.2 for the definition of SGL segments and descriptor types. The NVMe Transport may support a subset of SGL Descriptor types and features as defined in the NVMe Transport binding specification.
